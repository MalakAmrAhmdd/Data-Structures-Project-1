# Data Structures Project 1 - Cairo University

This repository contains solutions for Data Structures Project 1 from the Faculty of Computers and Artificial Intelligence, Cairo University. The assignment covers multiple fundamental data structure concepts using C++ without the STL library.

## Problems Covered  
- **Iftar Invitation Manager** – Object-oriented guest management system.  
- **Polynomial Operations Using Pointers** – Dynamic memory allocation for polynomial arithmetic.  
- **Sorted Linked List** – Implementing a sorted linked list with insertion, deletion, and operator overloading.  
- **Sorting Algorithms** – Interactive sorting system supporting multiple data types via templates, including Selection Sort on Palestinian city names.  
- **Statistical Calculations** – Computing median, mean, sum, min, and max dynamically.  

## Features  
✔️ Implemented in C++ with memory efficiency.  
✔️ No STL usage as per assignment requirements.  
✔️ Interactive menu-driven programs for user-friendly experience.  
✔️ Step-by-step sorting visualization and
